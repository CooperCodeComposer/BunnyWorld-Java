Final project for UCLA Extension Java 1 course 

Program simulates a population of male and female bunnies which reproduce every year. 

##Simulation Rules:
+ Initially 5 bunnies of random sex are born
+ Bunnies have a maximum life expectancy of 6 years
+ If there are male bunnies and female bunnies both with age >= 2,then for every female bunny with age >= 2, a new bunny is created.
+ If the total population reaches 100, 50% of the bunnies will chosen at random to die of starvation
